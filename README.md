# HTTP Client Extension

This extension provides basic blocks for sending HTTP GET and POST requests.

## Blocks

- `HTTP Client → GET [url]`
- `HTTP Client → POST [url] with [data]`

## Notes

This is a scaffold. You’ll need to implement actual communication logic depending on your hardware (e.g., ESP8266, ESP32, Jacdac).
